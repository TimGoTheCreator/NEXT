### Rotating Disk Galaxy Demo

This example generates a **rotating disk galaxy** with 20 000 particles.  
The disk has a radius of `0.5`, a vertical thickness of `0.2`, and a total mass of `1.0`.

Disk setups like this are useful for testing **galaxy stability**, **rotation curves**, and **flattened mass distributions**.
