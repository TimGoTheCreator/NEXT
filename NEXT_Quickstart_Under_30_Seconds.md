# ⚡ Run a NEXT Simulation in Under 30 Seconds

This quickstart shows how to build and run a minimal simulation using the **NEXT (Newtonian EXact Trajectories)** codebase in under 30 seconds on a typical developer machine.

---

## Prerequisites

- Git
- CMake (≥ 3.10)
- C++ compiler (Clang, GCC, or MSVC)
- Python 3 (for example input generation)
- OpenMP (for Multi-Threadding)

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimGoTheCreator/NEXT.git
cd NEXT
```

---

### 2. Build the simulator

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
cd ..
```

This produces the `next` executable in the root directory. 

---

### 3. Run a built-in example simulation

```bash
cd examples/TwoBodies
python two_body.py
../../next two_body.txt 8 0.01 0.1 vtu
```

**Arguments explained:**

- `two_body.txt` – input file generated by the Python script  
- `8` – number of CPU threads  
- `0.01` – time step  
- `0.1` – total simulation time  
- `vtu` – output format (VTK Unstructured Grid)

---

### 4. View the results

The simulation outputs a `.vtu` file in the example directory.

To visualize:
- Open the file in **ParaView**
- Load the dataset and press *Play* to view particle trajectories

---

## 🧠 What This Demonstrates

- Successful compilation of the NEXT C++ engine
- Generation of initial conditions via Python
- Execution of an N-body simulation
- Export of results to a standard visualization format

This workflow is intended as the fastest possible validation that NEXT builds and runs correctly.

---

## Notes

- Build times may vary depending on compiler and system.
- For longer or higher-resolution simulations, adjust thread count, timestep, and total time accordingly.
- Additional examples are available under the `examples/` directory.

---

✅ **Expected total time**: ~20–30 seconds on a modern development machine.
