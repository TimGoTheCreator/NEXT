# What is NEXT? 

NEXT is a new simulation engine written from scratch
NEXT uses **pure Newtonian Gravity**, 
However, NEXT is still young so that it isn't guaranteed it'll stay that. 
**Hydrodynamics, Dark Matter, or Radiation** might show up later. 

## How does NEXT preserve stability?

NEXT uses a **Barnes-Hut Octree** with **Higher-Order Multipoles** such as the following: dipole, quadrupole, etc. 
This means that far-away groups aren't treated as just "one lump" but NEXT contributes their
**Shape and Mass distribution**.

In practice, this gives
- *Much lower force errors than monopole Barnes-Hut*
- **Better Hamiltonian system stability**
- **Better Long-Term Stability**
- **Cleaner Energy Preservation**
- **More Reliable galaxy cluster interactions**

With Higher-Order-Multipole you can also
trade accuracy for speed:
tighter opening angle = more accuracy
looser opening angle = more speed. 

## What can you simulate? 

Anything that's mostly gravity:
- Hamiltonian Systems
- Star Clusters
- Galaxy Interactions
- Tidal Stream simulations
- General N-Body 

If you need gas, cooling, dark-matter -
NEXT doesn't have that yet.

NEXT has no weird unit systems, and it depends on the G parameter (1.0 by default) 

## Stability and Integrator

NEXT uses a standard **Kick-Drift-Kick Leapfrog Integrator**.
NEXT uses the KDK leapfrog because:
- It's simple to implement
- It's Symplectic
- Leapfrog is 2nd-order

Stability: NEXT uses an adaptive timestep and softening the adaptive timestep can be from 1% to 100% of the one set by the user.
The softening is calculated from how close particles are to each other.
