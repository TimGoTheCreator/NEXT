# What is NEXT exactly?

NEXT is an N-Body gravity code for astrophysics and such. 

## What does that mean?

Its a Computer program made in the low-level programming language C++ designed for running on workstations
or supercomputers that simulates forces between objects called **"Newtonian Gravity"**

## What does N-Body mean?

The term "N-Body" simply means **"multiple"** or **"many"** bodies, N could stand for 1, 500, or even millions!
**"Body"** refers to such object in the simulation, it could be a star, a planet, or just particles.

**So, an "N-Body" simulation is just a way of calculating how "N" objects move under gravity when they all pull in at eachother in the same time.**
